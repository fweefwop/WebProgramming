### Day 4
Let's learn about forms. Read Ch. 4 and work through the example code. Show your final form as in pg 55.   

### Day 5
We’ll learn about using a database. This is a big topic that we’ll be working on it for  multiple days. 
Let’s focus on SQL/Relational databases first. (Skip all No-SQL parts in the book for now) 

1. Reading: page 57 ~ 70 Concepts to learn: Primary keys, Foreign keys, Rows and columns
2. Lab: Follow the book and do table creating, inserting, modifying, querying, and deleting rows. 
Optional: Install DB Browser (sudo apt-get install sqlitebrowser) and use it to browse the database. 
Quick note: Here we use Sqlite as our database. It has the same SQL interface as other databases (Oracle, MySQL, etc.) 
but it’s a library instead of an independent application. So it’s very light weighted but with many constraints. Good for small applications.
